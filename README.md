# Hi, I'm Dipanker Vashist

I'm a Python developer with a strong focus on building practical, impactful software. Over the years, I've worked on personal projects that reflect my interest in combining code with real-world utility and creativity.

## Projects

- [**Mable Story**](https://github.com/Oxerene/Mable-Story): A 2D platformer game built using Python and Pygame, showcasing animation, collision logic, and game mechanics from scratch.
- [**Item Register Maintainer**](https://github.com/Oxerene/Item-Register-Maintainer): A GUI-based inventory management tool developed in Python with Tkinter, designed for small business use to track and manage stock efficiently.

## Current Focus

I’m actively building my expertise in:
- **Backend development** using Python frameworks like Django and FastAPI
- **AI/ML product development** with a focus on practical implementations and real-world use cases

## Career Goals

I'm working toward becoming a highly skilled software engineer, with a long-term goal of contributing to product teams at top-tier tech companies. I prioritize hands-on experience, scalable problem-solving, and constant improvement over theoretical study.
